    <h1>Plans for the Future</h1>
<p>I am currently a business major at the University of Maine. I don't know what I want to pursue exactly but it will be something in business. I want to be able to make a good amount of money one day. My real dream is to try to be a CEO of a company or maybe be an entrepreneur. I'm also really interested in sports management but that's not a major at University of Maine. There is s class here and I'm really excited to take it. I would say my three biggest influences for being in business would be the movies "Moneyball", "The Founder", and "The Wolf of Wall Street". Even though they're all movies, they're still based on a true story. I just love seeing people from the bottom of a business rise of and become really successful. Hopefully that can happen to me wherever I end up in the business world.   </p>
