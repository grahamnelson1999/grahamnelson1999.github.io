    <h1>Basic Info About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Graham Nelson and I am currently a Business Major at the University of Maine in Orono. This page just has some information about my life. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts and I grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts. If you look below there is a picture of my town. My interests in life are playing sports, listening to music, and hanging out with friends. My favorite sport is easily soccer. I've been playing it my entire life and it's given my a great number of friendships, including my closest friends. I obviously love to hang out with my friends. We always find fun stuff to do. We''l go to rope swings, play spikeball, sometimes play fortnite, or just go to places around Massachusetts finding stuff to do, </p>
